# test-datascience-lab
The intent of this mini project was to help me design a folder structure that would allow a team to work together on modules and Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis of a data set. However, the actual analysis was recreated from Jake Vanderplas tutorial available in YouTube.

Jake's tutorials can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZEWDGpM-vM&list=PL4SL0IvfckOt-EVMlxCPTMm4VlUpUWPtp

Thanks Jake!
